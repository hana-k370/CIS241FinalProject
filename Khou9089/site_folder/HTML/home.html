<h3><u>About Me!</u></h3>
<h4>Hi! My name is Hana Khouli, I am 21 years old and I live in Everett, WA. I go to Edmonds Community College 
and I am studying Graphic Design. I am studying Graphic design because I already enjoy anything that is art 
related and I thought that I should end up pursuing a job that relates to art or something that would allow me 
to be creative. I thought that Graphic Design is a way for me to take my love got being creative to another level.</h4>

<h4>A little bit more information about me, is that I grew up in Dubai, UAE. I have three brothers (two older and 
one younger than me) and I have a pet German Shepherd, named Laika. My Greman Shepherd was named 
after the first Russian dog that ever went to space. Unfortunately, that dog did not make it back home alive.</h4>

<h4>On a lighter note, out of my whole family I am the only one who is really good at anything that is art related 
and it is really easy for me to learn a new art skill. I really enjoyed Learning how to code in this class and I am 
really excited for my potential future in Graphic Design and where it could lead me to the next chapter in life.</h4>
