  <h3><u>My Reflections</u></h3>
  <h4>In this quarter I have learnt so much stuff about coding. I feel like I know exactly how <br>
  most websites are made or I feel like I have a general idea of what exactly goes into to making <br>
  and designing websites and how to customize them at the same time. Going into this quarter I felt <br>
  that since I was learning all of these coding skills online that it would be very hard for me to <br>
  properly grasp this coding class but I was fortunate to have a very helpful teacher and class mates <br>
  that would gladly help their fellow class mates (I did not ask for any help from them but I see the <br>
  way they comment on other people's posts and how sweat and helpful they are).</h4>
  
  <h4>I feel like my "Ah ha!" moment was this entire quarter because I was learning all diferent types <br>
  of skills and everything at the start of this course was new to me! I really enjoyed my time and I hope <br>
  that I get to learn even more coding skills in the future and I am super excited to be able to aply my <br>
  new coding skills in the real world</h4>
